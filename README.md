# LUCIA: Emotionally Intelligent AI Assistant

## Overview

LUCIA is an innovative conversational assistant designed to bridge the affective gap by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Facial Emotion Recognition (FER). This project implements two models: one utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and another employing a ResNet architecture for FER. Both models are integrated with an existing LLM, enabling LUCIA to recognize and respond to user emotions in real-time conversations.

## Abstract

As AI assistants become integral to daily life, their ability to understand and respond to human emotions is increasingly crucial. This paper introduces LUCIA, a novel conversational assistant that enhances user interaction by seamlessly blending advanced language processing with facial emotion recognition technologies. The implementation includes:
- A hybrid approach combining LLMs with FER to create emotionally intelligent responses.
- Evaluation of CNN and ResNet architectures for effective emotion recognition in conversational settings.
- Demonstration of LUCIA's capability to interpret emotional cues and enhance user experience through responsive interaction.

## Key Features

- **Emotion Recognition**: Integrates CNN and ResNet models for accurate facial emotion recognition.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses LLMs to understand and generate contextually appropriate responses.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Provides immediate feedback based on detected user emotions.
- **User Experience Enhancement**: Enhances interaction by adapting responses based on emotional cues.

## Installation

This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. To run LUCIA locally:
